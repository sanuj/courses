## Lecture 1

- C (Procedural Paradigm) - much easier to make memory errors
- Assembly
- C++ (Object oriented programming)
- Concurrent Programming - multiple functions seemingly simultaneously. Very useful in networks. Eg: Money withdrawal from ATMs and booking airlines ticket.
- Scheme (Functional paradigm), like Lisp.
- Python - modern object oriented version of Perl, is a scripting language. Make a web server in the end of course. It has procedural paradigm like C, object oriented paradigm like C++ and even some functional paradigm like Scheme. Has really good libraries. Client-Server Paradigm will be illustrated Python.
