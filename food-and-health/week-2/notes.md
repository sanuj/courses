## Why Are Highly Processed Foods Generally Less Healthy?
- Most of our food is refined or highly processed. Reasons to do this are:
    - Gives food a softer texture. :bread:
    - Extends shelf life of food.
- Refining process removes important nutrients like fiber, iron and B vitamins.
- Processed food lasts longer because pests, like mold, are less attracted to  food that are low on nutrients.
- Foods low in nutrients spoil slowly than foods rich in nutrients.
- A good predictor of healthy food diet is whether it was cooked by a human or a large corporation since the latter's business model is to start with cheap food and process it as much as possible, make it attractive with salt, fat and sugar (problematic nutrients for our health).
- Nutrient density is a good variable to consider while making sensible food decisions.
- Nutrient density of food can be defines as the amount of nutritional value including vitamins, minerals, and fiber, divided by the calories or energy content of that food.
- For eg. a glass of soda is high in calories without providing much nutrients. These type of foods are called energy dense foods - high calories and low nutrients.
- Nutrient dense food can be spinach, where nutrient value is relatively high compared to its caloric content.
- Fast food is considered cheaper because it has low cost per calorie but buying fewer calorie food of higher nutrient density is much better.
- Highly processed food is high in calories because it has lots of fat, sugar and salt to make the nutrient-stripped foods taste good.
- Additives like colorants, artificial flavors, stabilizers and other preservatives are also added to enhance packaged products and maintain the illusion that we as customers have many choices.
- Some processed foods are masqueraded as healthy foods that have synthetic nutrients added back after refining process to make the product seem healthy to a nutrition aware consumer. It's important to remember that most nutritious food like broccolli don't come in packages.

## Trends in Sugar Consumption and Recommendation
- Sugar consumption has increased in places where processed food is readily available.
- Some experts estimate that one-sixth sugar comes from desserts or sweets, majority of our sugar comes from highly processed food and sweetened beverages.
- Sugar is added in many foods under different pseudonyms and is present in foods like packaged breads, condiments, chips, sauces and salad dressings.
- Recently WHO recommended to limit the total sugar intake to < 10% of total calories consumed (better if it can be 5%). The sugars here are free sugars like those added by manufacturers, cook or consumer and sugars naturally occurring in honey, syrups and fruit juices but exclude the sugars found in whole fruits and vegetables. Sugar contained in milk is also excluded.
- Average adult calorie = 2000 cal/day which means 100 cal/day (5%) of sugar. Since free sugars offer 4 cal/gram => 25 grams of free sugar or 6 teaspoons is ideal for each day.
- 25 grams is a very difficult limit to maintain due to the added sugar in most of the processed foods.

## The Case of Cooking
- Home cooked food is the best deal for a good health.
- Due to the current culture most of our food demands are outsourced and cooking is viewed as a difficult chore that requires time.
- But home cooked food means simple food (not restaurant food) and can be easily managed if done by all members in family (including kids).
- Weekends can be used to prepare for the coming week by freezing vegetables and cooking things that can last the next week.
