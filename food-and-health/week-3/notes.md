## Cooking: Fundamental Ingredients
- It's not possible to shop for ingredients for cooking everyday so we need some basic ingredients in the kitchen that lasts the time between shopping trips and is suitable for cooking.
- These six basic ingredients are:
    - Olive oil
    - Onions
    - Garlic
    - Lemon
    - Sugar
    - Salt
- These ingredients are enough to transform fresh food in a meal.
- Also allow the cook to control sweetness, saltiness and acidity of meal.
- Whole grain pasta, cans of salmon and tuna, vinegar, soy sauce are also good choices that one should have in pantry to cook good meals.
- One can grow things like parsley, cilantro and basil in the garden too.
- By some planning and keeping right ingredients in fridge and pantry, good food can be cooked in 15-20 minutes. Eg: Some cans of wild salmon, olive oil, lemon, frozen spinach and whole grain pasta can be used to cook good dinner in no time.

## Cooking: Increasing Vegetable Intake
- One of the flaws of western diet is that it lacks the amount and variety of plant based foods needed everyday.
- It's important to increase the consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables by cooking it the right way.
- One of the best ways to start cooking a dish is to chop and saute onions in olive oil and maybe add garlic as well. After this more chopped veggies can be added like zucchini or spinach with a bit of salt and pepper to make a breakfast omelette.
- Tomato sauce can be easily made by chopping or blending tomatoes with some salt and colorful vegetable stir fry. Soy sauce or plum sauce can also be added.
- It is not necessary to eat organic to eat well. Sure, organic is good with less pesticide if one can afford it. But it's better to eat pesticide laden fruits and vegetables than none at all.

## Cooking: Sensible Substitutions
- Establishing a healthy diet has to focus on sensible substitutions rather than simple elimination of foods as skipping meals doesn't help to maintain a healthy weight because our bodies will find ways to make up for a perceived deprivation of food.
- Try to replace snacks you like with healthy home made substitutes:
    - Healthy dip (home whipped hummus) and fresh crisp veggies.
    - Making your own salad dressing instead of buying bottle salad dressing at the store. A simple vinaigrette can be thrown together in minutes and kept in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to a week.
    - Homemade popcorn. Get to control the salt and oil.
    - Homemade chicken nuggets. Needs six ingredients: Chicken (organic), flour, egg, breadcrumbs, olive oil and salt to taste.
    - Occasional piece of homemade cake by using eggs, a reasonable amount of sugar, butter, almond flour and baking powder.
    - Eating homemade dessert also helps to limit the intake of dessert because it's a lot of work to cook dessert.
- For every unhealthy food there is a homemade healthy couter-part and learning to cook these foods can be very beneficial form long term weight management.
