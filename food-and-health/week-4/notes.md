## Constructing a Healthy Plate
- Use smaller dinner plates, cups and glasses as larger plates make us overeat almost every time.
- Half of the plate should consist of plant based food with a mix of different colored vegetables.
- Different colored vegetables contain different micro-nutrients so eating a variety of them maximizes our nutrient coverage.
- Eating a variety of foods is also beneficial as it minimizes the chances of getting sick from potential contaminants in one food.
- The other half of the plate shall be equally divided in whole grains and lean protein rich foods.
- These sources can come from variety of sources.
- Repeating something (like chicken) every night is not healthy.
- Best drink to have is water. Drinking water before each meal will be helpful for weight management.

## Shopping in a Supermarket
- People think that to cook you must go to the farmers market and buy all local and organic food but that is not true.
- The first key decision is to move from processed food to real foods (plants, animals and some lightly processed food like pasta or flour).
- Stick to peripherals of a supermarket where you will find plants, animals, milk, eggs etc. Processed foods (cereals, chips, soda) are strategically placed at locations so they are easily visible to the consumer, one should avoid going to the super market when hungry to avoid buying high calorie processed foods.
- One way to tell if a food is hyper-processed is to look at the number of ingredients listed on the packaging.
    - Fewer ingredients signals less processed food.
    - If the few ingredients are recognized by a common person that also signals less processed food.
    - Best foods - fruits and vegetables don't come with a list of ingredients and are the best choices of all.

## Reading Nutrition Labels
- Try to avoid foods with nutrition labels because only the packaged foods have nutrition labels which are heavily processed.
- There is often more than a single serving in one container which can be misleading because the values are often for a single serving.
- Under the serving size, there is total calories.
    - Some healthy foods like nuts and avocados are high on calories but are also very good for health if eaten in reasonable amounts.
    - But if weight loss is a goal then if comparing two breakfast cereals, less calories is good.
- Dietary fiber is important for maintaining gastrointestinal health, stabilizing blood glucose and delaying the return of hunger. Choosing foods like breakfast cereals that are high on fiber is a good idea.
- The modern epidemics of obesity and diabetes are at least partly due to too much sugar in our diet.
- To convert sugar in grams to teaspoons - just divide by 4. 6 teaspoons are ideal for each day.
- Lots of children cereals contain 5 or more teaspoons in one serving.
- It's important to take note of the fat content - fats in processed foods are less healthy compared to fats in plant foods like avocados or nuts. These are naturally occurring unsaturated fats.
- Saturated fats in red meats and butter can be eaten in reasonable amounts.
- Trans fats usually found in processed foods should be avoided entirely. Legislation in the U.S. was passed in 2015 ordering food manufacturers to stop using trans fats because of the associated increased risk of atherosclerosis and heart disease.
- Foods with less sodium is also good. Processed food has excess of salt compared to the less processed versions.
- Nutrition labels also contain list of vitamins and minerals which can be misleading as added vitamins and minerals don't necessarily mean that the food is healthy.
- Some unhealthy foods have added vitamins and minerals to increase sales to the health conscious consumer.
